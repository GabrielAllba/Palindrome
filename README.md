## Project Prompt

Define a function is_palindrome() that takes:
```git
std::string parameter text.
```
The function should return:

true if text is a palindrome.
false if text is not a palindrome.
(A palindrome is any text that has the same characters backwards as it does forwards. For example, “hannah” and “racecar” are palindromes, while “menu” and “ardvark” are not.)

We will not test for edge cases such as capitalization or spaces.
